# CS350-SNHU
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project uses TI board CC3220X to create a smart thermostat.
This thermostat is using internal temperature sensor to detect if need to turn on or off the heater according tho the users set temperature.

What did you do particularly well?
The thing that I did particularly well was simplifying the project when it comes to the coding algorithm, and learning how to use the drivers from the TI board for the first time.

Where could you improve?
I could improve when it comes to best practices in the coding area.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The new tools and resources I'm adding are the knowledge to code and create with emerging systems, and the use of the architecture.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework? 
I'm not sure.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable? The project is very easy to understand and very easy to adaptable to changes by using clear variable names, and clear function names.
